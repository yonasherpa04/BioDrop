# Staff Management Portal

A modern, responsive web application built as part of the Frontend Developer Intern assignment. This portal allows staff members to manage their daily tasks through a secure login and an interactive dashboard.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Authentication:** A dedicated Login page with form validation and simulated JWT-style session management using `localStorage`.
* **Task Dashboard (CRUD):** A central hub where staff can view, add, update, and delete tasks in real-time.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully styled with **Tailwind CSS** to ensure a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
* **Fast Performance:** Built using **React.js** and **Vite** for optimized development and production builds.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **Icons:** Lucide-react / Heroicons

## 💻 How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the repository:**
   `git clone https://github.com/yonasherpa04/BioDrop.git`
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   `cd client`
3. **Install dependencies:**
   `npm install`
4. **Start the development server:**
   `npm run dev`

## 📈 Scalability Note (Production Ready)
To scale this application for a real-world production environment, I would implement the following:
* **Backend Integration:** Replace the local state with a **Node.js/Express** server.
* **Database:** Use **MongoDB** to ensure persistent storage of tasks and user data.
* **Security:** Implement real **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication and protected API endpoints.
* **Deployment:** Utilize **Docker** for containerization and deploy on platforms like Vercel or AWS.
